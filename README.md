# Iris-classification-using-machine-learning

The project will involve the following steps:

Data preprocessing: The data will be cleaned and prepared for analysis. This may involve dealing with missing or duplicate data, normalizing the feature values, and splitting the data into a training set and a test set.
Model selection: Different machine learning algorithms will be selected and tested to find the best one for the task.
Model training: The chosen algorithm will be trained on the training data using various techniques such as k-fold cross-validation.
Model evaluation: The model will be evaluated on the test data to measure its performance and identify any areas for improvement.
Model deployment: The final model will be deployed and used for classifying new Iris samples.
